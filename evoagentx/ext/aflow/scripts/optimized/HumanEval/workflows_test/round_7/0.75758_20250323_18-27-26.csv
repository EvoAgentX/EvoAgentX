1. We iterate from the second element (index 1) to the last element of the array.
2. For each element, we check if it is less than the preceding element. If this condition is true, we return the index of that element since it represents the largest index where the condition holds.
3. If we finish the loop without finding such an element, we return -1, indicating that all elements are in non-decreasing order.

","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the grid of wells represented by `1`s and then determine how many times we need to lower the buckets—given their specified capacity—to empty all of the wells.

Here's a step-by-step outline of the solution:

1. **Count the Total Water**: Iterate through the entire grid and sum up the `1`s. This sum will represent the total units of water present in the wells.

2. **Calculate Buckets Needed**: To find out the number of lowering actions required, divide the total water by the bucket capacity. Since any remaining water after full buckets will still need to be removed, we will round up the division (using ceiling).

3. **Return the Result**: The final count will give us the number of times we need to lower the buckets.

Now, let's implement this logic in the function `max_fill`:

```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    import math
    
    # Step 1: Count total water in the grid
    total_water = sum(sum(row) for row in grid)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the number of bucket lowers needed
    if total_water == 0:
        return 0  # No water to extract
    
    # Calculate the number of lowers needed
    lowers_needed = math.ceil(total_water / capacity)
    
    return lowers_needed

# Test cases to verify the function
print(max_fill([[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], 1))  # Should return 6
print(max_fill([[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2))  # Should return 5
print(max_fill([[0,0,0], [0,0,0]], 5))  # Should return 0
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Count the Total Water**: We use a nested list comprehension to sum all `1`s in the `grid`.
- **Calculate Buckets Needed**: The `math.ceil()` function is used to round up because even if there's a small remainder of water, we will need to lower the bucket one more time to deal with it.
- **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the number of times buckets need to be lowered.

This function efficiently computes the required number of bucket lowers based on the input grid and the capacity of the buckets and is designed to handle the constraints specified.","An error occurred: Error

- The function converts the number `n` into a string, allowing us to iterate over each digit.
- For each digit:
  - It checks if the digit is odd (using `d % 2 == 1`).
  - If it's odd, it's multiplied into a `product` variable and a `has_odd` flag is set to True.
- After iterating through all the digits, if any odd digits were found, the function returns the product; otherwise, it returns 0.

   - `upper_case_keys` checks if all keys are strings and if each string is uppercase.

### Explanation:
1. **Importing `re`:** We import the `re` module to use regular expressions.
2. **Defining the function:** The function `words_string` takes a single string input `s`.
3. **Using `re.split`:** We use `re.split(r'[,\s]+', s.strip())` to split the string into words. 
   - `r'[,\s]+'` is a regular expression pattern that matches one or more occurrences of either a comma `,` or any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, etc.).
   - `s.strip()` removes leading and trailing whitespace from the input string before splitting.
4. **Returning the result:** The function returns a list of words obtained from the split operation.

This implementation will correctly handle strings with a mix of spaces and commas as separators.","An error occurred:

print(order_by_points([]))                       # Expected output: []
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `order_by_points` takes a list of integers, `nums`.

2. **Helper Function (`digit_sum`)**:
   - This function calculates the sum of the digits of a number, ignoring its sign. It does this by converting the number to a string (after taking the absolute value), then summing the integer values of each character in that string.

3. **Enumerate the Input**:
   - `indexed_nums` holds pairs of each number with its original index (created using the `enumerate` function). This helps maintain the original order for elements with equal digit sums.

4. **Sorting Logic**:
   - The list is sorted using Python's built-in `sorted()` function. The key for sorting is a tuple:
     - The first element is the result of `digit_sum(x[1])`, which calculates the digit sum of each number.
     - The second element is the original index `x[0]`, ensuring that if two numbers have the same digit sum, they will remain in their original order.

5. **Return Value**:
   - Finally, the function returns a list of the sorted numbers, extracted from the sorted indexed pairs.

### Examples:
- When called with `[1, 11, -1, -11, -12]`, the output will be `[-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]`, showcasing how numbers are prioritized by their digit sums and then by their original order.
- An empty list returns an empty list directly.

3. **Conversion**: We convert the list of words into a list of numbers using the dictionary.

4. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted using the built-in `sort()` method.

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The function `add` accepts a single parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a non-empty list of integers.
2. **Total Initialization**: A variable `total` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the sum of the even elements found at odd indices.
3. **Loop through Odd Indices**: The `for` loop starts from index 1 (the first odd index) and iterates with a step of 2 to access all odd indices (1, 3, 5,...).
4. **Even Check**: Inside the loop, we check if the current element is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).
5. **Accumulation**: If it is even, add the element to the `total`.
6. **Return Value**: The function returns the accumulated total.

### Examples:
- `add([4, 2, 6, 7])` returns `2`, since index 1 has the even number `2`.

### Explanation:
- The function starts by checking if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it returns 0, because 1 has no divisors less than itself, and no numbers less than or equal to zero are considered in this context.
- It then uses a `for` loop to iterate backward from `n-1` to `1`.
- The condition `if n % i == 0` checks if `i` is a divisor of `n`.
- When it finds the first divisor, it immediately returns that value, which is guaranteed to be the largest divisor since we are iterating from `n-1` down to `1`.

2. Count how many pairs of brackets you have that create nested structures.
3. Return `True` if there is at least one nested pair and `False` otherwise.

Here is how you can implement the `is_nested` function:

```python
def is_nested(string):
    # Initialize a counter for opened brackets
    opened_brackets = 0
    # This variable will track if we found nested brackets
    nested_found = False
    
    for char in string:
        if char == '[':
            opened_brackets += 1
            # Check if we are already in a nested structure
            if opened_brackets > 1:
                nested_found = True
        elif char == ']':
            opened_brackets -= 1
            # If we ever close a bracket when there are no open brackets left, it's invalid
            if opened_brackets < 0:
                return False
            
    # We need to ensure all brackets are closed properly
    if opened_brackets != 0:
        return False

    return nested_found

# Test cases
print(is_nested('[[]]'))  # ➞ True
print(is_nested('[]]]]]]][[[[[]'))  # ➞ False
print(is_nested('[][]'))  # ➞ False
print(is_nested('[]'))  # ➞ False
print(is_nested('[[][]]'))  # ➞ True
print(is_nested('[[]][['))  # ➞ True
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The code uses a counter (`opened_brackets`) to track the number of currently opened brackets.
- If we encounter an opening bracket `[`, we increment the counter. If this counter exceeds 1, it indicates we have nested brackets.
- For each closing bracket `]`, we decrement the counter. If this counter ever goes negative, it means there are closing brackets without a matching opening bracket, so we can return `False` immediately.
- At the end of the loop, if `opened_brackets` is not zero, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so we also return `False`.
- Finally, if we have identified at least one nested structure during our traversal, we return `True`, otherwise `False`.

This way, the function correctly identifies whether there is a valid subsequence of nested square brackets in the input string.","An error occurred:

3. **Sorting and Reversing**: We sort `filtered` and then reverse it.
4. **Mapping to Names**: We use a list comprehension to convert each number in `filtered` to its corresponding name, using the `names` list.

### Explanation:

1. **Input Check**: If the `substring` is empty, the function immediately returns `0`, as there are no occurrences of an empty substring.

2. **Loop**: We continuously search for the `substring` starting from the last found index. 
   - We use `string.find(substring, start)` to find the index of the next occurrence of the substring.
   - If `find` returns `-1`, it means there are no more occurrences, and we break the loop.

3. **Counting**: Each time we find an occurrence, we increment the `count`. Then, we move the starting index one step further (using `start += 1`) to account for overlapping cases.

- The function checks if the input list `strings` is empty, and if so, it returns `None`.
- It initializes `longest_string` to the first string in the list, then iteratively compares the lengths of the remaining strings.
- If a longer string is found, it updates `longest_string`.

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: Check if the input list `numbers` is empty. If it is, return an empty list. If not, initialize `max_so_far` with the first element of `numbers` and create a list `result` that starts with this initial maximum.
  
2. **Iteration**: Loop through the remaining elements of `numbers`. For each element, update `max_so_far` to be the maximum of the current element and the previous maximum.

3. **Appending Results**: Append the updated `max_so_far` to the `result` list.

4. **Return Results**: At the end, return the populated `result` list.

### Example Use Case
```python
# Usage
print(rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]

### Explanation:
- `if n <= 1:` returns `False` for numbers less than 2.
- `if n == 2:` returns `True` since 2 is prime.
- `if n % 2 == 0:` returns `False` for even numbers greater than 2, as they cannot be prime.

### Explanation:

2. **String Conversion**: `str(abs(num))` allows us to iterate over each digit in the number easily.

2. We loop through each character in the input string:
   - If we encounter an opening bracket (`<`), we increment the balance.
   - If we encounter a closing bracket (`>`), we decrement the balance.
   - If the balance becomes negative at any point, this means there’s a closing bracket without a matching opening bracket, so we return `False`.

### Explanation of the Implementation

1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks that the length of the operator list is one less than the operand list, raising an error if not.

2. **Precedence Handling**: A dictionary defines the precedence of the operators.

3. **Apply Operation Function**: A helper function applies the necessary arithmetic operation based on the operator.

4. **Shunting Yard Algorithm**: This code handles operator precedence by converting the infix expression (the conventional format of expressions) into postfix notation (also known as Reverse Polish Notation), which allows for simpler evaluation.

5. **Stack Evaluation**: Once the expression is in postfix format, it's evaluated using a stack. Each operand is pushed onto the stack until an operator is encountered, at which point the necessary number of operands are popped, the operation is performed, and the result is pushed back onto the stack.

### Example Output

When you run this code with the example provided, `do_algebra(['+', '*', '-'], [2, 3, 4, 5])`, it will correctly output `9` reflecting the evaluation of the expression `2 + 3 * 4 - 5`. This approach keeps the code robust against operator precedence issues and avoids the security pitfalls associated with `eval`.","An error occurred:

","To implement the `special_factorial` function that calculates the Brazilian factorial according to the definition provided, you can use the following steps:

1. Create a helper function to compute the factorial of a number.
2. Use a loop to compute the product of factorials from `n!` down to `1!`.
3. Return the final product.

Here’s one way to implement this in Python:

```python
def factorial(k):
    """"""Helper function to calculate the factorial of k.""""""
    if k == 0 or k == 1:
        return 1
    result = 1

        result *= factorial(i)
    
    return result

# Example usage
print(special_factorial(4))  # Output should be 288
```

### Explanation:
1. **Factorial function**: `factorial(k)` computes the factorial of `k`. It returns `1` for `0!` and `1!`.
2. **Main function**: `special_factorial(n)` checks if `n` is positive. Then, it initializes `result` to `1` and iterates from `1` to `n`, multiplying `result` by `i!` for each `i`.
3. **Return**: Finally, it returns the accumulated product, which is the Brazilian factorial of `n`.

You can call the `special_factorial` function with different values of `n` to check its correctness against the expected output.","The solution passed the unit test.

    Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.
    Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...

","To implement the `hex_key` function that counts the number of prime digits in a given hexadecimal string, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the hexadecimal digits that are prime.
2. Iterate over the provided string and count the occurrences of these prime digits.
3. Return the count.

The prime hexadecimal digits according to the problem statement are: `2`, `3`, `5`, `7`, `B`, and `D`.

Here's the complete implementation:

```python
def hex_key(num):
    """"""Counts the number of hexadecimal digits that are prime.""""""
    # Define the set of prime hexadecimal digits
    prime_hex_digits = {'2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'}

        if char in prime_hex_digits:
            prime_count += 1  # Increment the count if it's a prime digit
    
    return prime_count

# Example usages:
print(hex_key(""AB""))         # Output: 1
print(hex_key(""1077E""))      # Output: 2

print(hex_key(""123456789ABCDEF0""))  # Output: 6
print(hex_key(""2020""))       # Output: 2
```

### Explanation:
- We define a set called `prime_hex_digits` containing the characters that represent prime digits in hexadecimal.
- We initialize a counter `prime_count` to zero.
- We loop through each character of the input string `num`. If the character exists in `prime_hex_digits`, we increment the count.
- Finally, we return the total count of prime hexadecimal digits.

This implementation efficiently counts prime digits in the input string and adheres to the constraints outlined in the problem description.","The solution passed the unit test.
