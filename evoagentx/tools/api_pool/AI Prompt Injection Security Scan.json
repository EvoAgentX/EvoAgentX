        "description": "PiScan - Enterprise-grade prompt injection detection API using advanced hybrid detection to identify and classify malicious attempts to manipulate AI systems. Combines lightning-fast pattern matching with sophisticated LLM analysis (Llama Guard 3) to catch both known and novel injection techniques. Detects role manipulation, delimiter injection, context breaking, jailbreak attempts, and obfuscation methods. Privacy-first architecture with self-hosted LLM - your data never leaves secure servers. Real-time risk assessment with scores from 0.0 (safe) to 1.0 (dangerous). Perfect for chatbot protection, content moderation, security monitoring, and AI applications."
