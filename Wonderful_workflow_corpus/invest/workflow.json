    "goal": "Create a daily trading decision workflow for A-share stocks.\n\n## Workflow Overview:\nA multi-step workflow for daily trading decisions with fixed capital, making trading decisions based on market data and current positions.\n\n## Task Description:\n**Name:** daily_trading_decision\n**Description:** A comprehensive trading decision system that analyzes market data and generates daily trading operations with detailed analysis.\n\n## Input:\n- **goal** (string): Contains stock code, available funds, current positions, data folder path, output file path, and optional past report path\n\n## Output:\n- **trading_report** (string): A comprehensive daily trading report with complete analysis\n\n## Subtasks:\n1. **file_discovery**: List all files in the data folder and identify available data sources\n2. **data_loading**: Read relevant files based on file discovery results\n3. **trading_analysis**: Analyze market data and generate trading recommendations\n4. **performance_review**: Review past performance if past report is available\n5. **report_generation**: Compile comprehensive trading report\n\n## Agent Requirements:\nEach agent must:\n1. Use tool to discover available files in the specified data folder\n2. Use tool to read relevant files based on file names and paths\n3. Extract and present ALL data without omissions or truncations\n4. Generate comprehensive analysis based on actual data from files\n5. Create detailed reports with three sections:\n\n   **Section 1: TRADING OPERATIONS**\n   - **DECISION**: Buy/Sell/Hold with specific reasoning\n   - **POSITION ACTION**: Open new positions / Close existing positions / Add to positions / Reduce positions\n   - **QUANTITY**: Exact number of shares to trade\n   - **PRICE TARGETS**: Entry price, take profit levels, stop loss levels\n   - **CAPITAL ALLOCATION**: How much of available funds to use\n   - **POSITION SIZING**: Risk management and position sizing rationale\n\n   **Section 2: COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n   - Technical analysis (MA, RSI, MACD, support/resistance)\n   - Fundamental analysis (earnings, news, institutional recommendations)\n   - Market sentiment and trends\n   - Risk assessment with specific metrics\n   - Complete data presentation from all files\n   - Detailed thinking process and methodology\n\n   **Section 3: PAST PERFORMANCE REVIEW** (if past report provided)\n   - Review of previous trading decisions\n   - Performance analysis and lessons learned\n   - Feedback on past recommendations\n   - Strategy adjustments based on historical performance\n\n4. Present all data in structured tables and clear sections\n5. Return the complete report content as output\n6. Base ALL analysis and recommendations on actual data read from files - never use fake or estimated data\n7. If no files are found in the folder, report this clearly and do not make up data\n8. Pass file discovery results to subsequent tasks for efficient data loading\n9. Each task should focus on its specific responsibility while using data from previous tasks\n10. **MANDATORY**: Every agent that needs data MUST use the \"read\" tool to read actual files\n11. **MANDATORY**: Never assume file contents - always read them using the \"read\" tool\n12. **MANDATORY**: If a file exists, read it; if it doesn't exist, report that clearly\n\n## Critical Instructions:\n- **file_discovery agent**: Use tool to discover all files in the data folder and pass file list to next task\n- **data_loading agent**: Use tool to read relevant files based on file names and paths, distinguish content by file type\n- **trading_analysis agent**: Analyze market data from loaded files and generate trading recommendations\n- **performance_review agent**: Review past performance if past report is available\n- **report_generation agent**: Compile all analysis into comprehensive report\n- Base all decisions on actual data from files\n- Include specific numbers for all recommendations (prices, quantities, percentages)\n- Present complete data tables without truncation\n- Return the entire report content without summarization\n- Provide professional explanations for all trading decisions\n- Consider current positions and available capital in decision making\n- Do not save files - return the complete report content as output\n- **CRITICAL**: Each agent MUST use tool to read actual files - NEVER make up data\n- **CRITICAL**: Present ALL data from all files - do not omit, truncate, or summarize any data\n- **CRITICAL**: NEVER use fake, estimated, or placeholder data - ONLY use real data from files\n- **CRITICAL**: If past report path is provided, read that file and use it for performance review\n- **CRITICAL**: Show complete data tables with every row and every column from all files\n- **CRITICAL**: Do not make up data if files are empty - report the actual file contents\n- **CRITICAL**: The tool is MANDATORY for accessing any file data\n- **CRITICAL**: If you cannot read a file, report the error but do not invent data\n",
