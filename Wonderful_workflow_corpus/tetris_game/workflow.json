Read the JavaScript code implementing game logic: <input>{javascript_code}</input>.\n4. Integrate these three code sections into a single HTML document:\n   - Ensure the CSS is included within a <style> tag in the <head> section.\n   - Ensure the JavaScript is included within a <script> tag before the closing </body> tag.\n5.
