# This example shows how to use the workflow to have a role play chat, with specific roles defined by user or a role already exists on the Internet.
# By running this file, the final workflow will be saved in the examples/output/workflow_examples_output/role_play_demo_{model_name}.json, where {model_name} is the model name used in the workflow.
